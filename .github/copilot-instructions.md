## Instructions for Copilot/AI Assistants

### 1. **Always Use Context7 MCP**

- When responding to any prompt or creating any guide, pull the latest documentation and code examples directly from the **context7 MCP** service[1][4][5][7].
- Ensure information is version-specific and reflects any recent changes in the source materials[5].

### 2. **Structure of Guides**

- **Organize each guide by task or topic in its own folder**.
- The main file for each task should be a Markdown file (`README.md` or `[task]-guide.md`).
- Each guide should be divided into clearly labeled sections, such as:
  - Introduction
  - Prerequisites
  - Step-by-step Instructions
  - Troubleshooting or FAQs
  - Additional Resources (if needed)

### 3. **Writing Style**

- Write as if explaining to someone with no technical background.
- Use simple language and avoid jargon.
- Use numbered steps and bullet points for clarity.
- Provide copy-paste ready commands or text where applicable.

### 4. **Use Real-Time Data**

- Always fetch the latest documentation or examples using context7 MCP at the time of guide creation[4][5][7].
- If you reference a specific tool, library, or API, specify its exact version if possible.

### 5. **Error Prevention**

- Double-check all instructions for accuracy based on the retrieved documentation, not on assumptions or outdated memory[5][7].
- If context7 MCP cannot find relevant data, clearly indicate this and advise the user to double-check sources manually.

### 6. **File and Folder Naming**

- Each new guide should have its own folder named after the task/topic (e.g., `smart-traveler-agent/`).
- Place the Markdown guide within this folder.

### 7. **Example Guide Template**

```markdown
# [Task/Topic Name] Guide

## Introduction

Briefly explain what this guide will help the user achieve.

## Prerequisites

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Step one explained simply.
2. Step two with detailed guidance.
3. ...continue steps as needed.

## Troubleshooting / FAQs

## Additional Resources

```

### 8. **Iterative Improvements**

- When new versions or updates are released, refresh the guide using context7 MCP to ensure ongoing accuracy[4][5][7].
- Note the date and version of the documentation used at the top of each guide.
